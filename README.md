## **Features**
- üé® **Graphical Map Interface**:
  - Nodes represent locations on the map.
  - Edges denote possible paths between locations.
  - Dynamic player position visualization.
- üïµÔ∏è **Detectives vs. Mr. X**:
  - Mr. X moves stealthily across the map.
  - Detectives collaborate to catch Mr. X.
- üîÑ **Real-Time Updates**:

## **Tech Stack**
### **1. Python (Pygame)**:
- Responsible for:
  - Rendering the map, nodes, edges, and player movements.
  - Displaying the game's outcome.

### **2. C++**:
- Implements:
  - Game rules and logic.
  - Movement updates for Mr. X and detectives.
  - Winning conditions.

### **3. File Communication**:
- Shared files enable Python and C++ to exchange data seamlessly.

## **Setup and Installation**
### **Prerequisites**:
- Python 3.8+ with **Pygame** installed.
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
- Required project files:
  - `positions.txt`, `detective_positions.txt`, `mrx_position.txt`, `game_result.txt`.
